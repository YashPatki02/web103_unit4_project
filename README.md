## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app or any additional context you'd like to add.

I had a cricket game this week and injured the ring finger on my right hand. I 
couldn't write or type for a few days due to the swelling. This prevented me from
completing my school work on time. Therefore, I was forced to use another extension
for this project. However, I am looking forward to working delegently on the group 
project.
